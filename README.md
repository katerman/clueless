# clueless
A small that is a virtual representation of the note paper from the board game clue.

Built in [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) using [React-Legend](https://github.com/katerman/react-legend) as a global store.

The purpose of this project was to make a production style application in React-Legend. The application itself is a replication of the note paper from clue. You can cross off which player does or does not have a specific card all from a mobile phone/tablet.

Online demo is available [here](http://clueless.refineddesigns.net/).
